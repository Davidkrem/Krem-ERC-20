# **David Kremenitzer's KREM Token (ERC-20)**

This project contains a **blockchain smart contract** that was used to deploy a **new** cryptocurrency Token **KREM**, an (ERC-20) on the Ethereum network, and successfully traded through the crypto decentralized exchange **Uniswap**.
\
&nbsp;

### **Introduction**

Using the Kovan Test Network - a public blockchain testing platform, KREM's smart contract was approved with a transaction hash and timestamp. The total supply of KREM's was then saved in a Metamask wallet prior to deployement on Uniswap's pool. The Solidity language was used to build the smart contract. The Ethereum documentation on ERC-20 Token Standards was referenced to create all functions, events, and transfer protocal. The code in the repo above was written exclusively in chrome browser with remix.ethereum.org
